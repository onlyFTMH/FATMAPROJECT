    <h3 id="baking">BAKING</h3>
    <p>I really love baking and enjoy trying recipes from around the world,
       not just traditional ones. Cheesecake in particular — I consider myself an artist at it.
       If you ask me about my favorite dessert, I'd say cake with berry sauce and light cream is the best.</p>

    <h3 id="editing">EDITING</h3>
    <p> Editing used to be my favorite hobby, 
        especially video and audio editing. 
        It helped me express feelings I couldn't share any other way. 
        Nowadays, I don't edit as much, but I'm still interested in it and I follow a lot of edits on social media.</p>

    <h3 id="piano">PLAYING PIANO</h3>
    <p>  Playing the piano brings me so much peace.
         Even though I'm still learning, I enjoy exploring different melodies and practicing songs I love. 
         It's one of the most relaxing and rewarding things I do. 
         It feels like I'm pouring all my emotions into the song when I play my favorite pieces. 
         It's such a joyful experience!</p>

    <h3 id="programming">PROGRAMMING</h3>
    <p> Programming might be the most challenging hobby for me, 
        but it's truly enjoyable. Especially in university, I feel a sense of competition with my classmates, 
        and my grades definitely show my love for coding. It can be exhausting sometimes, 
        but when I see the results of my hard work and study turn into something real, I feel a great sense of achievement.
    </p>

    <h3 id="diamond">DIAMOND ART PAINTING</h3>
    <p> Diamond art painting is my way of relaxing. 
        I love the patience it takes and the beautiful, sparkly results. 
        It's like building a masterpiece one tiny gem at a time. 
        And here I'll show you some of the diamond art paintings I made. I hope you like them!
